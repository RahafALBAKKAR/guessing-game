    <p>Befor we get start let me intreduce myself: <br/>
         <strong>My name is Rahaf ALBAKKAR</strong>I'm a computer engineer I graduated from TTU at 2016 
<hr/>
I worked in more than one company, but the field of work is far from my major, so I want to improve my skills in programming.
 I had the passion and ambition to be a skilled and creative Devloper.
Now I'm a trainee in ASAC, which gives me the excitement to learn more.*
